Basic Font Information
----------------------

KePT Serif is balkan enhancement of PT Serif.

PT Serif is a universal type family designed for use together with PT Sans 
released earlier. PT Serif coordinates with PT Sans on metrics, proportions, 
weights and design. It consists of six styles: regular and bold weights 
with corresponding italics form a standard computer font family; 
two caption styles (regular and italic) are for texts of small point sizes. 
The letterforms are distinguished by large x-height, modest stroke contrast, 
robust wedge-like serifs, and triangular terminals. Due to these features 
he face can be qualified as matched to modern trends of type design and of 
enhanced legibility. Mentioned characteristics beside conventional use in 
business applications and printed stuff make the fonts quite useable for 
advertising and display typography.

Each font next to standard Latin and Cyrillic character sets contains 
alphabet glyphs of title languages of the national republics of 
Russian Federation and support the most of the languages of neighboring 
countries. The fonts were developed and released by ParaType in 2010 with 
financial support from Federal Agency of Print and Mass Communications of 
Russian Federation as a second part of the project «Public Type of 
Russian Federation». Design - Alexandra Korolkova with assistance of 
Olga Umpeleva and supervision of Vladimir Yefimov.
