I wish you Happy 24 May - the Day of Slavonic Script - releasing version 1.1 of KePT fonts. 

KePT fonts are balkan enhancement of PT Sans and PT Serif fonts, licensed under the SIL Open Font License v1.1. 

You can think of "KePT" as a recursive acronym for "KePT is an Enhanced Public Type". ;)
